# The Meditating Ninja

The meditating ninja is an educational game that aims to help children with math. It provides a fun approach to memorise the times tables, and practice quick mental calculations. The ninja theme seeks to engage young students in the game. 

The objective of the game is to make a ninja meditate for as long as possible to make him get wiser. While he is meditating, many enemy ninjas try to disturb his meditation. The user may stop the enemy ninjas by using a shuriken (ninja star); however, a math question must be answered correctly to get shurikens. Therefore, the user should answer math questions as quick as possible to earn as many shurikens as they can to stop enemy ninjas. When an enemy ninja reaches the meditating ninja, the game is over, and the player score is the ninja's IQ.
